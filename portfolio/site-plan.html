        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Are you a Last Airbender fan? McQuinn Belnap is an illustrator, and he drew the Avatar characters into an Avengers poster.
            Would you like to see it?
            It’d be great to have a place people could view McQuinn's illustrations outside of social media. Having an online
            portfolio to showcase his work would provide a place for anyone interested to view his illustrative pieces.
            With a website independent of his Facebook and Instagram profile, people could have more convenient access to
            his storefront.</p> <!-- change this -->

            *for my personal site, I have elected to keep it very minimal in text information, as it has been suggested by several professors that a portfolio website for artists should get potential clients directly to the artist's work. I wont' include this in the content of the actual website, but I will answer these questions in hopes of fulfilling the necessary requirements of the W08 assignment.
        </p>
        <h6>Why will people come to my site?</h6>
        <p>To see my illustrative portfolio</p>
        <h6>What questions will your visitors expect my site to answer for them?</h6>
        <p>What has McQuinn illustrated? What style of art does McQuinn create? Where can buy McQuinn's tshirts? What is McQuinn's email?</p>
        <h6>What types of activities will vistors want ot complete on my site?</h6>
        <p>Portfolio viewing and store accessing</p>
        <h6>What information is necessary to complete any actions my site offers?</h6>
        <p>Pictures of my illustrations, my email address, and some about info</p>
        <h6>Why will my vistors come to my site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h6>
        <p>Uploading my illustrations in this format will give a better viewing experience for visitors, seeing how the image files are lossless.</p>

        <h5>I’m a bachelor of the arts in art.</h5>
        <h5>And I’m construction worker.</h5>
        <h5>And I just LOVE to draw. </h5>
        <p>I love to draw because I love progress. I love seeing an image come to fruition on a 2D surface. Drawing is an avenue through which we can give a physical form to ideas. Drawing lets us explore the universe. It can take us to places with lions, ligers, and bears…and an alien mage with a 47-foot-long tail.
